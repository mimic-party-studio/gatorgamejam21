## ABOUT \_ANALOGUE

**\_ANALOGUE** is a classic text adventure with added UI elements. The player is tasked with exploring their environment in order to find a way to get inside their university's Student Advocacy Center in order to get a disability accomodation letter for their classes. Outside, a monster stalks the campus sidewalks, forcing the player to move and hide tactically in order to survive.

The player is assisted by Al, an AI sponsored by the university who gives helpful insights into the world around them. They can also apply information they learn in the world to other applications on their phone.
